## **Introduction**

As part of the Code Challenge for the IS 24 Full Stack Developer Posting, this Web Application tracks and manages Web Applications developed by the Province of BC as described by the supplied User Stories.

## **How to run the app**

To launch the app in your environment, follow these steps:
### Setup
1. Clone the entire repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoorChasib/Noor-Chasib-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073.git
```
### Backend
1. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd Noor-Chasib-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073
```
2. Start the server for the Backend:
```bash
npm run start:backend
```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

### Frontend
1. In a second terminal window, navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd Noor-Chasib-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073
```
3. Start the server for the Frontend:
```bash
npm run start:frontend
```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the app.

### Note
